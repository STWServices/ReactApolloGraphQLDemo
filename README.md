# Signup, Login Into React Native Apps using graphQL, react-apollo with Facebook or Google Logging

## Backend
### Now, let’s set up the backend that handles signup, login using graphQL with mLab database and user authentication via Facebook and Google OAuth apps that we created in the previous steps.
These are the tools that we’re going to use:
•	Node.js. A platform that allows JavaScript to be used outside the Web Browsers, for creating web and network applications.
•	Express. Node.js web application framework.
•	Passport. An authentication middleware for Node.js.
•	Passport-Facebook. Facebook authentication strategy for Passport and Node.js.
•	Passport-Google-OAuth20. Google (OAuth 2.0) authentication strategy for Passport.
•	graphql-tools- graphql-tools package are not just useful for building servers. They can also be used in the browser, for example to mock a backend during development or testing
•	express-graphql- The express-graphql module provides a simple way to create an Express server that runs a GraphQL API.
•	Mongoose- Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
